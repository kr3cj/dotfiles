## Bootstrap from macos or linux
The below shortened url goes to raw.githubusercontent.com/kr3cj/dotfiles/main/home/.bootstrap.sh:

```
curl -L tinyurl.com/kr3cj-bootstrap | zsh
```

## Workstation customizations
I'm also trying to push all workstation customizations (macos or linux) into code that will automatically be set up in new environments. See `home/.workstation_setup.sh`.
